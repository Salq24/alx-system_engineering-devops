Impact:
Our e-commerce platform experienced significant slowdowns, resulting in a 60% decrease in transaction completion rates. Approximately 80% of our users faced delays in page loading and checkout processes.

Root Cause:
The root cause was an unoptimized database query that caused a bottleneck during peak usage.

Timeline
10:15 AM: Issue detected by a monitoring alert indicating a spike in server response times.
10:20 AM: Engineers confirmed the alert and began investigating potential causes.
10:30 AM: Initial suspicion fell on a recent deployment. Rolled back the deployment, but the issue persisted.
11:00 AM: Noticed high CPU usage on database servers. Assumed a DDoS attack and initiated mitigation protocols.
11:30 AM: Realized DDoS mitigation had no effect. Escalated to the database administration team.
11:45 AM: Database admin identified an inefficient query in the order processing module.
12:00 PM: Developers optimized the query and tested the solution.
12:30 PM: Deployed the fix to production.
12:45 PM: Monitoring confirmed resolution, and services returned to normal.
Root Cause and Resolution
Root Cause:
The issue was traced back to an inefficient SQL query introduced during a recent update to the order processing system. This query caused excessive load on the database during peak traffic periods, leading to slow response times across the platform.

Resolution:
The problematic query was identified and rewritten for efficiency. The revised query reduced the load on the database by optimizing the data retrieval process, significantly lowering CPU usage and response times.

Corrective and Preventative Measures
Improvements and Fixes:

Code Review Process: Enhance the code review process to include performance testing for database queries.
Monitoring: Implement more granular monitoring for database performance metrics, including query execution times.
Load Testing: Conduct regular load testing to identify potential bottlenecks before deployment.
Alert Configuration: Adjust monitoring alerts to detect and alert on abnormal query performance earlier.
Tasks:

Optimize Database Queries:
Review and optimize existing queries in critical modules.
Enhance Monitoring:
Integrate detailed query performance monitoring into our monitoring system.
Regular Load Testing:
Schedule quarterly load tests to simulate peak traffic conditions.
Review Deployment Process:
Update deployment procedures to include mandatory performance testing of database queries.
Training:
Conduct training sessions for developers on writing efficient database queries.
By implementing these measures, we aim to prevent similar issues in the future and ensure our platform remains stable and responsive under all traffic conditions.
